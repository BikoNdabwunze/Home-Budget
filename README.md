# Home Budget

## Context
This Project was completed as a part of my first application development class. It was done throughout the entire semester and was done as part of a team.

## Description
This app contains a database in which the home owner can add expenses and many other things related to their budget. The app allows the user to track, to delete and update expenses. The app also allows for a pie chart view of the expenses with the options for date filtering to allow for a better experience for the user.
